This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting audience ratings for movies using data from Rotten Tomatoes. The project explores multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a hyperparameter-tuned Stacking Regressor. It also features a neural network model for improved performance. The project includes robust data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation to ensure accuracy. The code is well-documented and structured for reproducibility.
